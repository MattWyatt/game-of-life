## conway's game of life
yeah it's just an OOP implementation of the game of life
it even has pretty colors!
if the cell is green, it'll live till next generation. red means it's going to die next cycle, and yellow means it will come back to life next cylcle.

## building
just run the cmake script, it'll do the rest. this whole thing should be cross platform besides the colored printing.
